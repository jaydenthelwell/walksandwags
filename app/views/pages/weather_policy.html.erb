    <h1 class="term_headers"><strong>Extreme Weather Protocol</strong></h1>
    <p>Effective Date: 28/06/2025</p>
    <p>At <strong>Walks & Wags Co.</strong>, your dog’s safety and comfort come first. Whether it’s hot sunshine, heavy rain, icy paths, or unexpected storms, this protocol outlines how I adapt walks and care during extreme weather conditions:</p>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>1. Temperature & Weather Guidelines</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heat (above 30°C):</strong> Walks cancelled and replaced with home/garden drop-ins to prevent heatstroke.</li>
        <li><strong>Brachycephalic breeds:</strong> No walks above 23°C—home/garden visits only.</li>
        <li><strong>Storms, lightning, or high winds:</strong> Walks may be cancelled or shortened if conditions are unsafe.</li>
        <li><strong>Snow, ice, or frost:</strong> Walks adjusted or cancelled to avoid slips and paw injuries. Grit and salt exposure will be avoided where possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Mild but manageable conditions:</strong> Walks may continue on safer routes (e.g. shaded trails, parks with good footing).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div></div>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>2. Timing & Duration Adjustments</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Walks are scheduled for the coolest or safest times of day, guided by detailed hourly forecasts from a reliable weather app.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot weather:</strong> Walks begin earlier (from 9:00–11:00 AM) or later in the afternoon to avoid peak heat (typically 11:00–17:00).</li>
        <li><strong>Snow, frost, or ice:</strong> Walks may start later to allow thawing and safer footing.</li>
        <li>If weather conditions become unsafe during the day (e.g., sudden storms, heat spikes, icy paths), walks may be shortened, rescheduled, or replaced with home visits.</li>
        <li>Dogs may be reassigned to different groups or time slots to ensure safety and compatibility under the adjusted schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>All changes and cancellations will be communicated promptly via WhatsApp, text, or email.</strong></li>
        <li>Shortened walks and alternative visits are charged at the full standard rate to cover care, supervision, travel, and scheduling efforts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Home Visit Pricing (per dog):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>£8 for ~15 minutes</li>
        <li>£17.50 per hour (if you prefer longer care)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>3. Hydration, Warmth & Cooling</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Water is doubled in warm weather and replenished throughout the day as needed.</li>
        <li>Frozen water bottles and car air-conditioning are used in summer to help regulate temperature during transport.</li>
        <li>Dogs may be briefly left in the vehicle while other dogs are picked up or dropped off — this is kept to a strict minimum, with the car parked in the shade and ventilation or air-con used where possible.</li>
        <li>In cold or wet weather, dogs are towel-dried and kept warm on return if necessary.</li>
        <li>Cooling bandanas in summer and dog coats in winter may be used depending on each dog's needs and the day’s conditions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>4. Activity Limitations</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No intense play (e.g. ball throwing) in extreme heat or icy conditions to prevent injury or overheating.</li>
        <li>In high temperatures, hour-long walks may be shortened to approximately 40 minutes, as full-length outings can be unsafe and physically exhausting for dogs.</li>
        <li>Shortened walks are still charged at the full hourly rate to cover the full service window, travel, supervision, and care provided during and around the walk.</li>
        <li>When walks are not safe or possible, they may be replaced with drop-in visits: £8 for ~15 min, or £17.50/hour for extended care.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>5. Paw & Pathway Safety</strong></h2>
      <p>Pavements are checked for temperature and slipperiness—hot pavement and ice pose significant risk. Walks are moved to grass, shade, or cleared paths when needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>6. Monitoring & Communication</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dogs monitored closely for discomfort or risk signs (heavy panting, shivering, limping, etc.).</li>
        <li>You will be notified promptly via WhatsApp, text, or email about any changes or cancellations.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>7. Client Options</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexible care alternatives offered during unsafe weather: £8 drop-in or £17.50/hr extended visit.</li>
        <li>Available even if your usual walk is cancelled or moved to a different time.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="terms_section">
      <h2 class="term_headers"><strong>8. Client Responsibilities</strong></h2>
      <p>Please let me know if your dog has weather sensitivities or health issues (e.g. arthritis, breathing problems, intolerance to heat or cold). Keep access paths clear and safe when snowy or icy.</p>
    </div>
