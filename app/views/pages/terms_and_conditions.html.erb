      <p>At Walks & Wags Co., the safety and well-being of the dogs in our care is our top priority. In cases of extreme weather or unforeseen circumstances, walks may need to be adjusted, rescheduled, or, in rare cases, cancelled.</p>
      <div>
        <h5><strong>6.1 Extreme Weather Conditions</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hot Weather:</strong> Walks will be adapted to keep dogs safe and comfortable. Adjustments may include shorter routes, shaded areas, frequent water breaks, and avoiding hot pavements to prevent paw burns. If temperatures are dangerously high, we may cancel walks for the dog's safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy Rain & Storms:</strong> Walks will continue in light rain, but during severe storms, high winds, or flooding, we may shorten or postpone walks for safety. Dogs will be thoroughly dried upon return.</li>
          <li><strong>Snow & Ice:</strong> Routes may be adjusted to avoid hazardous areas, and walks may be shortened. If conditions make walking unsafe, walks will be cancelled. <strong>For certain breeds with thin coats or small size (e.g., whippets, greyhounds, toy breeds), we may require coats and boots to be provided. If these are not available, we may be unable to walk your dog in severe winter weather.</strong></li>

        <ul>
          <li>If Walks & Wags Co. staff are unwell or face an emergency and are unable to complete scheduled walks, we will notify clients as soon as possible.</li>
          <li>Where possible, alternative arrangements will be made, such as rescheduling the walk or arranging for a trusted backup walker.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5><strong>6.3 Client Cancellations Due to Weather</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li>If a client wishes to cancel a walk due to extreme weather (such as heavy snow, high winds, or storms), </strong>no cancellation fee will apply, provided we are notified in advance.</strong></li>
          <li>However, if walks are cancelled due to mild weather conditions (e.g., light rain), the standard cancellation policy applies (see <strong>4.2 Cancellation Policy</strong>).</li>
          <li>If you know your dog struggles in specific weather conditions, please discuss this with us in advance so we can agree on a plan that prioritises their comfort and safety.</li>

      <p>At Walks & Wags Co., we aim to ensure your dog is clean and comfortable after their walk, but we are not responsible for any additional grooming or cleaning fees.</p>
      <div>
        <h5><strong>8.1 Basic Cleaning After Walks</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Towel Drying</strong>: After each walk, if the dog becomes dirty (e.g., muddy paws, wet fur), we <strong>will wipe them down with a towel</strong> to remove excess dirt and moisture. This ensures that they are as clean as possible before returning home.</li>
          <li><strong>Use of Water</strong>: If the dog is particularly muddy or has gotten wet in the rain, and if an outdoor hose or water source is available at the property, we may use water to rinse off dirt or mud. We will only use water if the client has provided access to a hose or tap and it is safe to do so.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5><strong>8.2 Excessive Dirt or Mud</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li>In cases where a dog is extremely muddy or dirty and additional cleaning is required (beyond a quick towel dry), <strong>we may shorten the walk</strong> to allow time for cleaning, but please note that additional grooming services or extensive cleaning are not part of the walk fee.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>Trial Walks</strong>: New dogs will undergo a trial period of up to <strong>5 walks</strong>.

It also provides an opportunity to gauge how the dog responds to the walker’s style and how they interact with the walking environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Behavior Assessment:</strong> During this trial period, we will observe the dog for signs of anxiety, aggression, excessive pulling, or other behaviour that might affect the quality of the walk or the safety of the dog or other animals.</li>
          <li><strong>Owner Feedback:</strong> We will provide feedback to the dog’s owner after the trial period to discuss any concerns or recommendations based on the dog’s behaviour during the walks.</li>

          <li>We will communicate any concerns or issues with the owner and, where possible, offer recommendations for improvement or alternative services. In some cases, we may refer the owner to a specialist trainer if the dog’s behaviour requires more attention.</li>

        <h5><strong>13.2 Termination by Either Party</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Notice Period: </strong>Either party may terminate services at any time, provided that <strong>one week’s notice in writing</strong> is given. This gives both the client and Walks & Wags Co. time to make alternative arrangements. Written notice should be sent via email or text, confirming the request to terminate services.</li>
          <li><strong>Outstanding Payments: </strong>All outstanding fees for past walks must be paid in full before the termination of services is finalised. The client must also pay for any walks scheduled during the one-week notice period, regardless of whether they choose to use them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><strong>13.3 Owner Cancellations Without Service</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cancellation Fee:</strong> If the owner terminates services but chooses not to use any walks during the required one-week notice period, they will be charged <strong>75% of the cost of one week's worth of walks,</strong> based on the average weekly fees from the past four weeks. This fee compensates Walks & Wags Co. for the reserved time and the loss of scheduled appointments.</li>
