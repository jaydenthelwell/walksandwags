      <p class="font-dog-walk-guide">Dog walking isn’t just about getting your pup out of the house—it’s crucial for their physical health, mental stimulation, and socialisation. Here’s why:</p>
      <ul class="font-dog-walk-guide">
        <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular walks help maintain a healthy weight and build muscle.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Stimulation:</strong> New environments and experiences keep your dog's mind sharp.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Consistent walks help curb unwanted behaviors like excessive barking or chewing.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonding:</strong> Walking together strengthens the relationship between you and your dog.</li>
      </ul>

              <p>"Jayden is a great walker; kind, reliable, patient and she obviously loves dogs! Whilst this is a new venture her care and professionalism is second to none. She took time to understand our dog, his needs and was careful to ensure that he would fit into the pack. Our dog seems very happy and we'd definitely recommend her."</p>

              <p>"Jayden has been an incredible and reliable friend for our little boy, they instantly bonded.
  Peso (🐶) loves going out with Jayden , they go on long walks in parks and forests with other dogs , sometimes even longer than initially planned, which is fantastic , as my little boy gets all the fresh air and playtime he needs. Jayden has been a real life saver for us as she responded to last minute requests from us and thanks to her we had someone looking after Peso while we were busy. Highly recommend!"</p>
